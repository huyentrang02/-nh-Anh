                    WHEN IS INTERNATIONAL DAY OF HAPPINESS 2023?
                </div>
                <div class="letter2">
                   - International Day of Happiness is a global event arranged by the United Nations annually on March 20. It serves to remind us that being happy is a human right and worth celebrating — and if you’re not already happy on this day, the celebrations may change that!

                    HISTORY OF INTERNATIONAL DAY OF HAPPINESS
                </div>
                <div class="letter3">
                   - A holiday called International Day of Happiness may sound a bit infantile to the uninitiated. Perhaps you’re imagining children singing ‘If you’re happy and you know it…’ or people gleefully dancing under a smiling sun and rainbows. While you’re not entirely wrong — who doesn’t like a good sing-song session — the truth is there’s much more to this delightful day than just smiles and good vibes.

                <div class="letter3">
                   - We celebrate International Day of Happiness thanks to the work done by the United Nations and its partner nonprofit group Action for Happiness, which is composed of people from 160 countries. The ultimate goal of the movement is to spread awareness that progress is not only about increasing bottom lines and encouraging economic growth, but well-being and human happiness as well. In 2011, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution that made it a “fundamental human goal” to give happiness as much priority as economic opportunity. Two years later, in 2013, all 193 member states of the UN celebrated the world’s first International Day of Happiness, and it has continued to grow since.

                   - So as you listen to Pharrell Williams’s ‘Happy’ on repeat, also take a minute this March 20th to consider what truly makes you happy, and how you can pursue it.
